## ranger-cd

Compatible with ranger 1.4.2 through 1.7.\*

After ranger quits, automatically change the current directory of zsh to the
last visited directory in ranger.

Code comes from a [ranger plugin](https://github.com/ranger/ranger/blob/master/examples/bash_automatic_cd.sh)
for bash, repacked as an oh-my-zsh plugin for zsh.
